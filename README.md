Block Storage Units:
Each Unit Contains A Chest Full of Whatever Tile or Wall The Unit is For, in a Small Stone Slab Display.
Some of them still could use a little editing for better organization (ie dungeon walls and cursed variants arent organized as well as they should be, etc)
eventually i will be making these changes as well as adding any missing blocks

Crafting Centers:
These are various crafting areas

Farms:
These are various Farms for items that can be grown or grow naturally

Housing:
These are housing, they may range from simple structures containing just a single room or two, to full houses

Storage Building Material Sets:
These are whole sets of storage such as every paint/coating in the game.


Future Additions Planned:
Fixes to Block Storage Units / Missing Blocks
Resource Farms
Mob Farms
Fishing Areas
Statue Devices
Logic Gate Stuff
Crafting Areas
Housing
Elevators and Bridges
Areas
and Many Others.

This will however take a good bit of time to build and release to the world for anyone interested in using them with T-Edit.
