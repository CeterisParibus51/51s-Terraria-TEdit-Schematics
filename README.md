Terraria Schematics for TEdit

This repository contains Schematic Files For TEdit a program for editing terraria maps which can be found here:
https://www.binaryconstruct.com/tedit/
or on their github page here
https://github.com/TEdit/Terraria-Map-Editor

as of writting this version was TEdit 4.15

Currently Ive Only Uploaded The Individual Units For Block Storage.
Each Unit Contains A Chest Full of Whatever Tile or Wall The Unit is For, in a Small Stone Slab Display.
Some of them still could use a little editing for better organization (ie dungeon walls and cursed variants arent organized as well as they should be, mud and mud wall are seprate, etc)
eventually i will be making these changes as well as adding any missing blocks

Future Additions Planned:
Resource Farms
Mob Farms
Fishing Areas
Statue Devices
Logic Gate Stuff
Crafting Areas
Housing
Elevators and Bridges
Areas
and Many Others.

This will however take a good bit of time to build and release to the world for anyone interested in using them with T-Edit.
